史诗级盗贼技能：让高等级盗贼技能更有用

版本 3.6

专职盗贼（尤其是无宗派的）到高等级时很无聊，主要原因是盗贼技能的高数值用处不大。开锁、寻找陷阱、侦测幻象和装设陷阱技能超过100 几乎完全没有意义，对高等级盗贼来说，专职盗贼相比兼职盗贼、以及无宗派盗贼相比于刺客或赏金猎人都毫无优势，因为即使后者到了那个时候也能将他们的技能升到足够高。

本模组有多个组件，可以让相应技能超过100的盗贼更有用：

1.史诗级锁

史诗级锁需要开锁技能超过100才能打开。本组件将很多原先不能打开的魔法锁改为史诗级锁，让你可以在队伍里有开锁大师的情况下，稍微改变某些事件流程。史诗级锁不能用敲击术打开（那样太容易了），只能用开锁技能，但你依然能用原先的方式（剧情事件或者使用钥匙）打开史诗级锁，所以本组件不会让你在没有盗贼的情况下无法通关游戏。本模组包含的史诗级锁举例如下：

*杜拉格之塔存放榨酒器引擎开关的抽屉（需要开锁技能115）
*杜拉格之塔变形怪层的滑动门（需要开锁技能130）
*艾瑞尼卡斯地牢中需要魔像打开的门（需要开锁技能105）
*神殿遗址中原先不能打开的暗影门（需要开锁技能130）
*乌斯特·拿萨的大门（需要开锁技能205）
*其它还有很多！

另外，本组件还将游戏中一些普通锁改为史诗级锁。这么做不是为了限制玩家获取钟爱的魔法物品，仅仅是因为那些锁改为史诗级是合理的。博德之门一代中改为史诗级锁的普通锁只有公爵官邸的宝箱，而且这些锁都不影响剧情。我还在新加的有史诗级锁的容器中放了些特别的魔法物品。这些就留给你自己去探索了。

2.史诗级陷阱

史诗级陷阱也类似，需要寻找陷阱技能超过100才能解除。本组件主要将原本游戏中不能解除的触发装置改为史诗级陷阱。举例如下：

*杜拉格之塔每轮释放火球的陷阱（需要寻找陷阱技能110）
*杜拉格之塔符文地毯上的陷阱（需要寻找陷阱技能150）
*博德之门二代守卫豪宅第一层的召唤陷阱（需要寻找陷阱技能155）
*次元监狱能将你传送到一个房间的肉状传送陷阱（需要寻找陷阱技能230）
*其它还有很多！

本组件还将游戏中一些普通陷阱改为史诗级陷阱，主要在巴尔王座部分，这里面某些陷阱触发的法术很酷，游戏中几乎没有别人会施放！

3.史诗级陷阱装设

This component overhauls all the trap setting abilities (Set Snare, Set Special Snare, Set Spike Trap, Set Exploding Trap, and Set Time Trap) so that rather than improving based on the thief's level, they improve based on the thief's Set Traps skill. They get more powerful for every 50 Set Traps points the thief has, with the highest threshold being a Set Traps skill of 250 or higher. For characters less skilled at setting traps, the traps will be less powerful than in the base game. However, for characters with extremely high Set Traps skills, the traps will be potentially slightly more powerful than in the base game. In addition, since trap power is no longer based on level, if you have your thief put all of their points into Set Traps at each level up, they could get high-power traps really early (though at the cost of forsaking their other thieving skills).

4.史诗级偷窃

This component does two things. First, it changes the minimum Pick Pockets requirements necessary to steal items that a creature is holding in certain inventory slots. In the base game, it is impossible to steal a creature's helmet, shield, boots, or armor. With this component:

*Stealing a creature's helmet requires at least 105 Pick Pockets
*Stealing a creature's shield/off-hand weapon requires at least 120 Pick Pockets
*Stealing a creature's boots off their feet requires at least 180 Pick Pockets
*Stealing a creature's armor requires at least 290 Pick Pockets (think of this as the thief equivalent of being Elminster).

Even with this component, you cannot steal from a hostile creature. There doesn't seem to be anything I can do about that.

The second thing this component does is allow you to steal from a couple of stores you couldn't steal from before. This is far less comprehensive than the changes to locks and traps in the other components. Only a few stores were changed, mainly some of the major, high-profile stores in Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. I'm going to list all of the stores I changed because I don't want you to be afraid when you're about to steal from some random store that I might have made it super-difficult to steal from.

* High Hedge - Stealing Difficulty: 105
* Sorcerous Sundries - Stealing Difficulty: 115
* Thunderhammer Smithy - Stealing Difficulty: 120
* Sorcerous Sundries (in Siege of Dragonspear) - 160 (because there's a whole big crowd of people there)
* Adventurer's Mart (both the regular goods and the secret goods) - 180 (because the Amnian Soldier is watching you carefully the whole time)

For comparison, the hardest store to steal from in Baldur's Gate II normally is the Copper Coronet, with a stealing difficulty of 128. The merchant in Trademeet who sells you the Girdle of Inertial Barrier has a stealing difficulty of 30.

NOTE: How the stealing difficulty works is that you have a 1% chance to steal an item successfully for every 1 point of Pick Pockets you have greater than the stealing difficulty of the store. In order to be able to steal an item from the Adventurer's Mart 100% reliably, you need 280 Pick Pockets (which is still easier than stealing someone's armor).

5.史诗级侦测幻象

This component makes it so that if a thief has over 100 in Detect Illusions, they have a chance to detect illusions even when they aren't actively trying. A thief will have a 1% chance to passively detect illusions for every 1 point of Detect Illusions above 100.

This component also makes it so that characters with a Detect Illusions skill of at least 100 can effectively see invisible creatures and target them with spells or abilities. This also affects shamans, once they reach 100 Detect Illusions.

6.新技能：使用毒药

This component adds a brand new skill to the game: Use Poison! Thieves can put points in this skill like the other skills. Having a high Use Poison skill increases any poison damage dealt by the thief, whether from traps, an assassin's Poison Weapon, or from weapons and missiles that poison the target. Assassins start with +20% to their Use Poison skill. Thieves get +4% to the skill for every point of Intelligence they have over 10.

Before installing this component, you must install EEex, which allows the creation of new thieving skills.

7.禁止多瓶感知力药水或盗王之王药水的效果堆叠

Since it would be too easy to deal with these epic locks and traps simply by having your mage-thief chug lots of Potions of Perception and Potions of Master Thievery, this component lets you prevent the effects of more than one Potion of Perception/Master Thievery from stacking.
